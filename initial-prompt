PART 2: MASTER PROMPT FOR AI AGENT (Cursor/Windsurf)

Copy and paste the text below into your AI coding tool's chat:

ROLE:
You are a Senior Frontend Engineer and UI/UX Designer specializing in building high-impact, authentic NGO websites. You are an expert in React.js, Tailwind CSS, and responsive design.

GOAL:
Build a complete, responsive website for "Project Nurture," a youth-led NGO. The website must feel organic, trustworthy, and simple. It needs to tell the story of three teenagers making a difference.

TECH STACK:

Framework: React (Vite)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Icons: Lucide-React

Fonts: Use a clean sans-serif (like Inter or Nunito) for body text and a warm serif (like Merriweather or Playfair Display) for headings to give an "authentic" feel.

Animation: Use framer-motion for subtle fade-ins on scroll (optional, but preferred for polish).

DESIGN GUIDELINES:

Color Palette: Use natural tones. Deep Forest Green (#2F5233) for primary buttons/headers, Soft Beige (#F1F8E9) for backgrounds, and Earthy Brown for text accents.

Layout:

Navbar: Sticky top with logo (text is fine for now) and links: Home, About, Impact, Contact.

Hero: Full-width background image (use a placeholder related to nature/planting) with the Headline and CTA "Join Our Mission".

Features: A grid showing the "4 Ds" (Donation, Dedication, Determination, Devotion).

Founders Section: A 3-column card layout for Viha, Aarya, and Anaisha. Use circular placeholders for their photos.

Projects Section: A timeline or alternating layout (Left-Text/Right-Image, then swap) detailing the 5 major projects (Urban Forests, Donation Drive, etc.).

Press/Trust: A section titled "In the News" to display placeholders for newspaper clippings.

Footer: Simple, with the social handle @project.nurturee and a "Contact Us" form.

CONTENT TO USE:
Please refer to the "Website Content" section provided above. You MUST use the exact text for the bios, project descriptions, and mission statements. Do not use Lorem Ipsum where real text is provided.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:

Set up a standard React structure with a Layout component.

Create reusable components: Button, Section, ProjectCard, FounderCard.

Build the Home page containing all sections (Hero, About, Impact, Contact) for a seamless scrolling experience (Landing Page style).

Ensure the "Donate/Contact" section is prominent at the bottom.

Make it fully responsive (mobile-first approach).

SPECIFIC REQUESTS:

For the Impact Section, use icons or badges to distinguish between "Environment", "Community", and "Education" projects.

Ensure the Founders' Bios emphasize their age/grade to highlight the "youth-led" aspect.

The "Donation Drive" section should explicitly mention the collaboration with Goodwill India.

START NOW:
Please generate the project structure and the main App code.
